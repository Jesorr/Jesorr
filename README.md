# Hi! I'm Elliott Sorrells ðŸ‘‹

I'm an aspiring junior data analyst transitioning from a 6-year career as a firefighter in Austin, TX. Over the past year, I've been dedicated to learning and honing my data analysis skills, and I'm eager to jump into the field full-time.

## Technical Skills
- **SQL**
- **Excel**
- **Tableau**
- **PowerBI** (currently completing the Business Intelligence Analyst bootcamp through TripleTen)

## Soft Skills
- **Effective Communication:** Developed through conveying critical information during emergency situations.
- **Adaptability:** Accustomed to rapidly changing scenarios in the fire department.
- **Work Well Under Pressure:** Experienced in managing crisis situations efficiently.

## Education
- **TripleTen Business Intelligence Analyst Bootcamp:** A comprehensive 6-month program covering SQL, Excel, Tableau, and PowerBI.

## Hobbies
I lead a very active lifestyle. I enjoy exercising, walking, and hiking with my family. With small children at home, most of my free time is spent with them, making the most of family activities.

## Professional Goals
My primary goal is to transition into a full-time data analyst role as soon as possible, preferably in a remote position to accommodate my family's needs. However, I am open to relocating if it's in my family's best interest.

## Projects and Experience
During my bootcamp, I worked on various practical projects that involved:
- **Business Analytics**
- **Data Visualization and Storytelling**
- **SQL**

Feel free to explore my repositories to learn more about my projects and the skills I've developed.
